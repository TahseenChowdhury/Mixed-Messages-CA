# Mixed Messages | A Codecademy Project

## Purpose

This tool is designed to generate a random message every time a user runs a program. In order to ensure that the message is random, the tool will produce an output that is made up of at least three different pieces of data. For this scenario, I will be building a tool that randomly generates a message within the following framework:
> This computer believes that [SUBJECT] should go [ACTION VERB] before they go [ACTION VERB2]!

## Implementation Plan

**Built On**: Javascript

1. Create a subject array and populate said array with random strings of subjects.
2. Create an action verb array and populate said array with random strings of action verbs.
3. Create a function that pulls a random string out of an array.
4. Create a function that verifies that the two random action verbs selected are not the same so that the sentence makes sense. 
5. Create a function that produces the intended sentence with the random strings in the message.
